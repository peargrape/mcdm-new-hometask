# Marketing common data modelling challenge
Here is my hometask done.
See my tables and an MCDM table [here](https://github.com/peargrape/dbt_mcdm_challenge/tree/main/models)

See my Looker dashboard [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/c6bdd3c0-4481-4e61-be48-e623cfad610c/page/tEnnC).
BTW, there is an issue with graph 'Cost per engage' as there is no data somehow related to the engagements metric similar to the one from Twitter table. Therefore, the original graph 'Cost per engage' from the example seems to be wrong. The rest graphs correspond.


As for a brief set of instructions for adding data from new ad platforms into my MCDM, I would advise the following:
1. create a new file named by a platform (e.g., amazon.sql) with a query
2. update the existing mdcm_table.sql file with the data from the raw .csv file
3. the model is ready, and we can create a dashboard

To sum up, it was a pleasure to do this task, and I enjoyed it. I learned how to work with dbt useng BigQuery as a data warehouse, as well as it was my first experience in Looker. THe instructions you provided were helpful.

I hope this hometask will meet your expectations, and we will meet at an interview.

Anyway, thank you for the opportunity.

Best wishes,
